# Joker App

An app with multiple flavors uses multiple libraries and Google Could Endpoints.
It implements the following items:

* Project contains a Java library for supplying jokes
* Project contains an Android library with an activity that displays jokes passed to it as intent extras.
* Project contains a Google Cloud Endpoints module that supplies jokes from the Java library. Project loads jokes from GCE module via an async task.
* Project contains connected tests to verify that the async task is indeed loading jokes.
* Project contains paid/free flavors. The paid flavor has no ads, and no unnecessary dependencies.
* App retrieves jokes from Google Cloud Endpoints module and displays them via an Activity from the Android Library.
* The free app variant displays interstitial ads between the main activity and the joke-displaying activity.
* The app displays a loading indicator while the joke is being fetched from the server.
* The root build.gradle file contains a task that will start up the GCE development server, run all Android tests, then shutdown the development server.
